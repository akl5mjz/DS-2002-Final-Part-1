DOCUMENTATION AND ANALYSIS

In this project, I created a program that retrieves data from a remote API every minute, storing it in a
relational Sqlite database for 60 minutes. The API provides data on "factor," "pi," and "time."  The code used can be
found in the 'analysis.py' and 'data_ingestion.py' files which store and pull from the 'api_data.db' file.  To ensure
proper execution every minute for 60 minutes, I relies on Python's asyncio library.  The script initiates at 00 minutes
and continues for an hour storing data to a relational database.  For simplicity, I chose Sqlite.

My analysis pointed out some key patterns:

Examining the correlation between factor and time reveals an apparent pattern of exponential growth as it seems the
factor is cubed with each increase in minute.

Analyzing the relationship between pi and time shows something different however as pi begins at a high of 4.0 but then
quickly drops to 3.14 within the first two minutes of the hour and stays stable thereafter for the remainder.

Lastly a similar relationship is seen between factor and pi over the course of the hour.  Pi starts out at 4 while
factor begins close to 1.  Then pi drops to 3.14 quickly  but factor continues to exponentially increase over the
course of the hour.

In summary, a robust positive relationship exists between the time and factor variables, indicating exponential growth
as time progresses. However, the relationships between time and pi, as well as pi and factor, exhibit minimal
correlation, with pi maintaining a relatively constant value despite increases in both time and factor variables.
